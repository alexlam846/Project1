	 <h1>My Pets</h1>
	 <h2>Marcie</h2>
	 <video src="photos/marcievid.MOV"></video>
	 <p>Known as Marcie, Marceline Lam was born in the month of February of 2017 (wish her a happy birthday). The day of her birth is unknown. She is a brown, derpy Chihuahua that loves belly rubs and running around. 
	    She especially loves stealing socks and using them as toys. Marcie will always try to hop in the car with my mother whenever she goes out, even though the highway makes her anxious. Even though she is very sweet, she
	    is not well trained. Since she is not housebroken and cries anytime someone steps outside.

	 <h2>Nova</h2>
	 <img src="photos/nova.JPG" alt="Nova being nosy">
	 <p>Nova is 6 years old and was born on April 4th in the year 2014. She is a pitbull terrior that loves munching on snacks and eating, which has caused her to have some overweight issues but she has gotten better.
	    She too likes to steal socks, but Nova steal socks to get attention rather than to play with them. Nova really likes getting attention, as she will often come to my room and lay her head on my lap while I am working or studying.
	    She is much better trained and is house broken, and knows commands like sit, lay, paw, jump, speak, and go to bed.
