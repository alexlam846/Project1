	  <h1>The Squad</h1>
	  <p>On this page, I will show members of my squad with a brief description of them. WARNING: Due to the fact that I don't want to be cancelled, 
	  most of the statements on this page should be taken lightly as they are most likely a joke.</p>
	  <h2>Lucas Knudsen</h2>
	  <img src="photos/lucas2.jpg" alt="A dazed and confused Lucas">
	  <p>Mr.Knudsen is the King of Clowns, usually the one making the most jokes and being the funniest person in our group. Although he is 
	  mostly of European descent, he often brags about his Native American roots. He is most known in our group for being very stubborn when it comes
	  to video games, as he will play hours and hours of Destiny without playing video games with his friends.However, it is never a dull
	  moment with this gentlemen.</p>
	  <h2>Freddie Ortiz</h2>
	  <img src="photos/freddie2.jpg" alt="This is the only picture I have of him">
	  <p>Fredward has had his ups and downs with our group, as he is often refered to as a "simp" whenever his girlfriend is involved. Furthermore,
	  Fred's sense of time is the most awful thing I have witnessed on this entire earth, as he will reach a destination hours after the 
	  set time of arrival that he himself established. Despite his imperfections, he is a fun person to be around and is very generous with 
	  a car ride home or inviting us to his house.</p>
	  <h2>Ahmed Ashour</h2>
	  <img src="photos/ahmed2.jgp" alt="A young Ahmed in high school">
	  <p>An aspiring politician, Ahmed can ironically be the life of a party. He loves playing beer pong, and he often refers to me as the 
	  "Messiah" whenever we play. He will often get into heated discussions about soccer with Lucas that usually end with an exchange of insults.
	  Although he can come off as obnoxious sometimes, he is a very caring and thoughtful person.</p>
	  <h2>Joseph Riveria</h2>
	  <img src="photos/joseph2.jpg" alt="This is my contact photo for him">
	  <p>As the most responsible person, Joseph is the dad (or daddy) of the group. Making sure we do not get into serious trouble while also making 
	  sure we have fun at the same time. He is also really good at video games and is a vulable team member, but is obnoxious and toxic when playing 
	  such games. It is even worse when playing against him as he will tuant you and use devious strategys to win such as stealing kills. He truly is
	  the scum of the earth. Otherwise, he is a cool dude to be around. </p>
	  <h2>Ruben Nava</h2>
	  <img src="photos/ruben2.jpg" alt="A hot and sweaty Bolo">
	  <p>Robert, Bolo, Dr.Dragon(Misspelled)Night,Funky Kong, Roy Bowser, whatever you want to call him, Ruben tends to be the butt of a joke. His 
	  tendacy to take jokes and dish jokes back makes him an enjoyable person to be around. Often the host of our numerous game nights and extravaganzas, 
	  he cares deeply about his friends and passionately despises his enemies in a admirable and poetic way (makes sense since he majored in art). He 
	  defintely would NOT get angry about being at the bottom of the page, and be annoyed instead that he was second to last.</p>
	  <h2>Brandon Samson</h2>
	  <img src="photos/brandon2.jpg" alt="The last time Brandon was happy">
	  <p>Last and difinitely least, is Brandon Samson. Although he is Asian like myself, he is ironically more related to Joseph because of their Purto 
	  Rican roots. Often described as Maui and the one who wears the shorts in the relationship, Brandon is very thoughful when it comes to bringing food 
	  and picking people up from his car (sometimes). He loves Attack on Titan, and he (alongside Ruben) and I would often talk about anime. He is also really 
	  good at flip cup.</p>
	  <h2>About the Author</h2>
	  <img src="photos/alex2.jpg" alt="Stares in toxic masculinity">
	  <p>Arguably the sexiest man alive, I am down to do whatever the group suggest so long as everyone is having a good time (although I can get carried
	  away). I'm a jack of all trades, neither a master nor a novice, and can easily pick up on games on the first try. I'm also known for being awfully blunt, 
	  which has gotten me in trouble from time to time. The way I see it, I will always give my honest opinion if someone asks for it (unless it will get me 
	  expelled or if the truth requires that I speak more than I would like to).</p>
