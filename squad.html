	  <h1>The Squad</h1>
	  <p>On this page, I will show members of my squad with a brief description of them.</p>
	  <h2>Lucas Knudsen
	  <p>Mr.Knudsen is the King of Clowns, usually the one making the most jokes and being the funniest person in our group. Although he is 
	  mostly of European descent, he often brags about his Native American roots. He is most known in our group as very stubborn when it comes
	  to video games, as he will play hours and hours of Destiny without playing video games with his friends.</p>
	  <h2>Freddie Ortiz</h2>
	  <p>Fredward has had his ups and downs with our group, as he is often refered to as a "simp" whenever his girlfriend is involved. Furthermore,
	  Fred's sense of time is the most awful thing I have witnessed on this entire earth, as he will reach a destination hours after the 
	  set time of arrival that he himself established. Despite his imperfections, he is a fun person to be around and is very generous with 
	  a car ride home or inviting us to his home.</p>
